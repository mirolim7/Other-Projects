Hello Dear Students!!!

Your task is to build a model that will predict value for the variable - Target (numerical), 
i.e. it is a regression problem. Use 'train.csv' file for training your model/models. 
Predict the Target variable for the test dataset in 'test.csv' file. Note that you don't have 
access to Target variable in the test dataset. Evaluation of models should be done based on the 
following metric: MSE - mean squared error.

Submission format:
Save your predicted values in csv format;

Provide only two columns:
Id, Predicted Target 

Description of columns:
Id - id of the observation
Target - target variable
N1 to N6 - numerical variables
C1 - ordinal categorical variable
C2 to C9 - nominal categorical variables
